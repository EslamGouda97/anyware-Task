Steps to see what i did:
1-I made users,announcement and quizzes models at backend to make crud operation at each one.
2-If u want to reach the dashboard u must sign in with email and password to get a token and reach the dashboard.
3-I didn't make UI for sign up so u can sign in with :
email: eslam@test.com
password:eslam123
4-I made slices and store to fetch announcemnt and store it with redux and use it at dashboard
5-I also made slices for each user and quizzes but there is no ui to display the data from backend.
6-I exported the postman file so u can test the backend within it. 
7-this is the url of the backend at vercel hosting (https://any-ware-backend-awhf.vercel.app/)
----I am so sorry for the bad responsive i am so busy so i focused at backend firstly,forgive me.------
